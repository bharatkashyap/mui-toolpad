# Toolpad

<p class="description">A framework to build full-stack apps, fast. It can be used as a Next.js starter, or integrated within an existing React project to build dashboards and internal tools. </p>

This framework leverages the existing suite of components offered by MUI, and ties them together with the most commonly-used backend integrations. Imagine a React dashboard template but with backend features like authentication, role-based access control and data fetching already included. It comes with the guarantee of MUI's enterprise-tested components, and the Toolpad team's focus on using the latest stable libraries, and prioritising razor-sharp performance.

## Overview

:::

Toolpad can be multiple things: a set of low-level primitives for common use-cases like state management across components; a Next.js starter with backend features like authentication baked-in. To sum up: it is a framework that integrates many disparate tools which otherwise require a lot of inefficient glue code to work together. The framework is accessible through a Command Line Interface (CLI) which generates starter code quickly based on features needed or example templates to be followed.

The framework follows the open-core model, with some features being available under the MIT license, and some being under a paid license.

## MIT version (free forever)

This version provides clean abstractions for all basic features that a user needs while building a simple admin tool or dashboard, such as building fetching and mutating server-side data and authentication for users with multiple OAuth providers.

## Pro version

The Pro version includes and extends the features available in the MIT version to support more complex use cases. It packs in support for integrating role-based access control with providers such as Azure Entra for unlimited users; unlimited audit logs for all actions performed, automatic notification management for authenticated users and more.
