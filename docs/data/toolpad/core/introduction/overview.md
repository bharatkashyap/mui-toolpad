# Toolpad Core - Overview

<p class="description">A general, high-level description of Toolpad Core and its capabilites.</p>

## Introduction

Toolpad Core is a set of open-sourced components and primitives to help you build full-stack applications fast. When you build an application with Toolpad Core, you get UI for **authentication**, **role-based access control**, **navigation**, **notifications** and others pre-made, along with primitives to connect to the server to read and mutate data. At the same time, you retain control of your codebase since the output is always 100% React.

## Key features

- **Open-source**: Toolpad Core is open-sourced, which means the code is free for you to observe and inspect, forever!

- **Pure-code**: Toolpad Core **generates React**, not configuration files in `.yml` or `.json` - no attempt to lock you in to Toolpad Core. You are free to take the output and customize it as your own React app.

- **Ecosystem**: Toolpad Core uses **Material UI components** to bootstrap pages for your app and provides **abstractions over the MUI X Data Grid and Charts** to create dashboards and internal tools fast.

- **Extensibility**: Toolpad Core allows you to **bring in your own heavily customized Material UI components** to integrate with its primitives for server-side data reading and mutation.
