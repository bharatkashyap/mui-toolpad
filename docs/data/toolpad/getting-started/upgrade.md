## Plans

A few features in Toolpad are placed under a pro plan. These are:

- not covered under the free-forever MIT license
- will require the purchase of a paid license to use in production

The following features are currently planned to be included within this scope:

### Authorization

Features allowing you to grant conditional access to pages to certain roles are part of our proposed paid plan. Read more about this on the dedicated page for [authorisation](/toolpad/concepts/rbac/).

## How to upgrade

Currently, accessing these features requires you to add the following to your `application.yml`:

```yml
spec: { plan: pro }
```

Using these features in production will require the purchase of a paid license. Please get in touch with us at [toolpad@mui.com](mailto:toolpad@mui.com) if you require to purchase a Toolpad license.
